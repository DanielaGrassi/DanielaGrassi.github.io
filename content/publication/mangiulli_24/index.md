abstract: While it is well-established that authentic emotional autobiographical memories elicit physiological responses, research suggests that this elicitation can also occur for fabricated autobiographical memories. Yet challenges arise from awareness discrepancies when considering two research fields Participants in memory studies may be unaware of producing false memories, while liars are aware of fabricating false events. Hence, in two experiments, we compared the psychophysiological pattern of true autobiographical memories with fabricated memory narratives. Using noninvasive biometric devices to measure heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL), participants were tasked with recalling both true and fabricated negative and neutral autobiographical experiences in a written (Experiment 1) and oral (Experiment 2) way. While in Experiment 1, no statistically significant differences were detected in..
