## Hello Hello!

I am Daniela, a PhD student researching engagement, emotions, and other affective states in work environments. My work focuses on analyzing physiological data—such as heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA)—to better understand human interactions in modern work contexts. I am a member of the [Collab research group](https://collab.di.uniba.it/), where we explore the intersection of human-centered computing, collaboration, and affective technologies.
