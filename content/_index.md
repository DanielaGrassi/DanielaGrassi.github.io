        My research focuses on emotional awareness in collaborative work, with a focus on recognizing and using affective and cognitive states to support well-being and performance.

        I study how physiological signalsâ€”such as heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA) and EEGâ€”combined with user input and contextual information, can provide insights into stress, engagement, and emotional dynamics during work activities.

        The goal is to develop non-intrusive methods and tools that promote emotional self-awareness, reduce stress, and support reflection in both lab and real-world settings.
